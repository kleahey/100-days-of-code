##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1:  January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** It was a great start today diving in head first to learning how to build an app with Ruby on Rails.  Got started on a new project integrating with Spotify's API.

**Thoughts:** It's only day one and I feel like I'm gaining lots and lots of knowledge.  This is probably the most fun I've had with a New Year's Resolution ever.
