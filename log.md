**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 7:  January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** More work learning the Ruby language

**Thoughts:** More work on continuing to learn Ruby language and syntax so that I can write better programs in Ruby.  I also had the opportunity to go into some of my existing Ruby programs and correct some issues with some of the things I have been learning over the last couple of days!

### Day 6:  January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** More work learning the Ruby language

**Thoughts:** More work on continuing to learn Ruby language and syntax so that I can write better programs in Ruby.  I have to keep telling myself that slow and steady wins the race.

### Day 4:  January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:**  Connected an AWS EC2 database to an external source using the ruby gem 'mysql2'

**Thoughts:** I have been wanting to learn how to get access to the MySQL server on an EC2 instance for some time.  Having external access allows me to gain access to the production database on my development server.  The overall process was very easy, and didn't take long to implement throughout an existing ruby app.

### Day 3:  January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Today was all about security.  I decided that I didn't want my media server exposed to the internet, so I installed and configured OpenVPN on the server for remote access.

**Thoughts:** OpenVPN is the definition of open source software.  It is definitely not without fault, but has an extremely large user-driven support community.  Now that I have gotten my media server configured, I'm really excited to get back on track with developing my Rails apps.

### Day 2:  January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Today I took a brief detour from completing the Rails blog app to fix my media server.  I am upgrading hardware, and needed to rebuild my Plex, Sabnzbd, Deluge, Sonarr, CouchPotato, Headphones, and LazyLibrary applications on the new server. I got some great experience with file permissions.

**Thoughts:** Every time I use Linux, I feel more and more comfortable with it. I'm at a place where I prefer to use the Linux command line over any other operating system.

### Day 1:  January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** It was a great start today diving in head first to learning how to build an app with Ruby on Rails.  Got started on a new project integrating with Spotify's API.

**Thoughts:** It's only day one and I feel like I'm gaining lots and lots of knowledge.  This is probably the most fun I've had with a New Year's Resolution ever.
